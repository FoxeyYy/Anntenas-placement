# Antennas-placement

This repo contains all implemented solutions for the antennas placement problem.
  1. OpenMP
  2. MPI
  3. GPU - CUDA
  
The problem is as follows:
>Antenas must be placed in a matrix untill there is no greater distance that the given one.
>Distances are manhattan ones. The next position where to place an antenna must be the very first position with the largest distance following a sequential meaning.

Besides parallel techniques, algorithms have been optimized as well.
